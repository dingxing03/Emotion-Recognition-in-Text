# Introduction


# Dataset
1. ISEAR dataset contains a total of 76666 sentences and 7 emotion labeled: Anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame, joy, and guilt.

# Methodology
- The methodology used for this project involves the following steps:
1. Text Preprocessing: 
    - Lowercasing
    - Expanding contractions
    - Removing punctuation, special characters, digits
    - Tokenization
    - Handling negations
    - POS tagging
    - Stemming and Lemmatization
    - Removing stopwords
2. Feature Extraction: 
    - Bag of Words
    - TF-IDF
    - N-gram
    - Word Embeddings such as Word2Vec, FastText
3. Model Development and Evaluation: 
    - Machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine
    - Deep learning models such as CNN, RNN and Bi-LSTM
    - Transformer-based models such as BERT, XLNet, DistilBERT, RoBERTa
